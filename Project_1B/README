lab1b-server.c:
Source code used to generate the lab1b-server executable.
Creates a server that listens for a client connecting on a specified port.
Once a client connects, client input is forwarded to a shell, whose output is returned to the client.

lab1b-client.c:
Source code used to generate the lab1b-client executable
Connects to a server on a specified port, then runs shell commands remotely on the server, and displays the results of those commands on the client.

Makefile:
Provides targets for generating executables. These targets include default, client, server, clean, and dist.
Executables are compiled with -Wall -Wextra -lz options.

default: Creates executables for both lab1b-server and lab1b-client.
client: Creates executable for only lab1b-client
server: Creates executable for only lab1b-server
clean: Removes all files created by the Makefile. These include the executables lab1b-server, lab1b-client, and the distribution tarball.
dist: Creates a tarball with all the files needed to compile and execute the program. These include the source files, Makefile, and this README.

README:
Provides a description for the contents provided by the tarball. 

Much of the code used to do compression was taken off of the zlib website.
In particular, the sample code provided at https://www.zlib.net/zpipe.c. was used as reference, and altered to work with buffers instead of file streams.
