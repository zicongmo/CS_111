lab1a.c:
Source code used to build the lab1a executable.
The executable places the terminal into no-echo mode, and will manually process all keyboard input and echo it to stdout.
If compiled with the --shell option, the terminal will forward keyboard input into a shell, and echo back the shell output.

My code does not pass the confirming correct large-burst input processing case in the sanity check.
The output is as follows, but I was not able to find the error.
