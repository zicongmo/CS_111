Contents:
lab4c_tcp.c: Source file used to build the lab4c_tcp executable.
The executable connects to the server at the specified host and port, and sends temperature reports from the beaglebone until told to stop.
The connection is maintained via TCP.
lab4c_tls.c: Source file used to build the lab4c_tls executable.
The executable connects to the server at the specified host and port, and sends temperature reports until told to stop.
The connection is maintained via TCP, and secured using OpenSSL.
Makefile: Provides easy way to build the following targets:
	default: Builds the lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls executables, compiling with -Wall -Wextra
	clean: Removes files generated by the Makefile
	dist: Builds the tarball
README: Provides a description of the contents of the tarball.

Much of the OpenSSL code was written after reading an online tutorial at:
